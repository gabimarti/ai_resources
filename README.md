## AI Chat systems Sitelist 

* [ChatGPT - chat.openai.com](chat.openai.com)
  The first chat site with Artificial Intelligence that was widely and massively released to the world. First version of ChatGPT was released to the world by OpenAI in June 2020.
  It allows to ask questions and responds in a natural way to the questions asked, although in some cases it is convenient to contrast the information with reality. For programming tasks you can generate code samples, which in some cases may contain errors, be incomplete or even use libraries or functions incorrectly. But if you are asked for very short and concrete tasks or functions, it usually helps quite well.
  The version of ChatGPT-3 was released in November 2022 and is the one that reached massive diffusion, going on to upgrade to version GPT-3.5 a few weeks later.

* [BratGPT - https://bratgpt.com](https://bratgpt.com)
  ChatBot in the style of ChatGPT 3.5, very similar in its interface. Its answers are ironic and sarcastic, and it is not intended to give good or intelligent answers, but to play with the user trying to provoke him and make him look ridiculous in front of his questions. Simply to pass the time and close it after 5 minutes.

* [YOU.com - https://you.com/search?q=who+are+you&fromSearchBar=true&tbm=youchat](https://you.com/search?q=who+are+you&fromSearchBar=true&tbm=youchat)
  You.com Chat is an online communication system that uses artificial intelligence to provide accurate and helpful answers to users' questions. It can help users find information by performing related searches on the web to solve problems. It is able to generate answers to code-related questions by creating code examples presented in text format. For programming tasks it is similar to ChatGPT but also offers web search results. 

* [Pi - https://heypi.com/talk](https://heypi.com/talk)
  Pi, is developed by Inflection AI. It is a conversational application based on an artificial intelligence model. It is able to converse with users on a wide variety of topics and interact in a natural way. For programming tasks it is not as direct and efficient as ChatGPT or You.com Chat, as it asks a lot of questions following a conversation, giving a line to follow without offering concrete code samples.



## AI Developer Tools

* [GitHub Copilot - https://github.com/features/copilot](https://github.com/features/copilot) [PAID]
  GitHub Copilot uses the OpenAI Codex to suggest code and entire functions in real-time, right from your editor.
  It is developed by OpenAI, i.e. the same company that created ChatGPT, so presumably the generated code can have the same level of successes as errors.
  It can be installed in JetBrains IDEs, Neovim, Visual Studio and Visual Studio Code. CoPilot is a paid service.
  
* [codeium - https://codeium.com](https://codeium.com) [FREE] 
  Chat is integrated into your IDE. Integrates with the most common IDEs and editors, such as Visual Studio Code, JetBrains, PyCharm, XCode, Android Studio and many more. It has an extension for Google Chrome (works also in Opera) to be used in online editors.
  Generates code for more than 70 languages based on your information. In my tests using C language it has not been very accurate.


* [bito.ai - https://bito.ai](https://bito.ai) [FREE]
  It is based on ChatGPT-4. It has a chat that integrates into Chrome (also in Opera) where it generates code in a window. It is more versatile (for my taste) than Codeium when used as a browser extension. It integrates in different IDEs of the JetBrains family and in Visual Studio Code. It has the ability to explain what a code that is provided or that we have selected within the editor does.
